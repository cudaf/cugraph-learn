The RAPIDS cuGraph library is a collection of GPU accelerated graph
algorithms that process data found in GPU DataFrames.

**Research**: Infectious Disease Modeling, Monsoon 2020<br>
**Guided by**: Prof. Kishore Kothapalli, Prof. Sriram Pemmaraju
<br>

See [Colaboratory] for notebook, but it takes about *15min* to setup Rapid's
**cuGraph** onto it, before starting. [BlazingSQL] has cuGraph already setup
onto it, but you need to write your own notebook (it has no share feature).
With BlazingSQL you need to copy `data` as well and `main.py` into its
environment.
